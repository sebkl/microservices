# microservices

This microservices repository contains a set of minimal web-services which are frequently used by myself for a wide range of individual applications, tools and services. They have been extracted for convinience purposes and may act as example services for my golang [GOTOJS](http://godoc.org/github.com/sebkl/gotojs)  package.


## Usage

Currently there are two types of microservices:

* Plain **gotojs** services
* Services that could be used as **appengine** modules

### gotojs

```TBD```

### appengine
The appengine service do also contain some basic html5 web frontend which also shall act as sample applications.

```TBD```
